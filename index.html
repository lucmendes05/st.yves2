<p>
I wish it could be this time next Thursday,<br>
live within a coin flip - live within the closing of a curtain, <br>
in the lamina of faith on the eighth floor, <br>
from the balcony next to the room I was born in and 8am has never been so distant; <br>
</p>
     
 <p>      
I will never not be at that party again, <br>
in that classroom again, <br>
every time I close my eyes to take me there again, <br>
to where I was when I was younger and everything was so far away; <br>
 </p>

<p>
I don’t want to bury my grandparents <br>
- if I see a shovel I swear I will bite - <br> 
to be an adult and grow up, <br>
to smoke more often and alone, <br>
not hear the stories of days that died with him and her so soon; <br>
</p>
     
<p>
promise you won’t disappear if I accept this, <br>
tell me that you won’t hold yourself to it, <br>
trust in me and peace will come, <br>
the music will keep playing and the beaches will go nowhere - <br>
there is a balance in the whisper of a word, <br>
in the shaking breath that reads it and the pause which follows; <br>
</p>
