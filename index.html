<hr>
<p>
Hidden in my skin is their faith, <br>
With my blemishes emerge a mosaic, <br>
My scars each a piece of this puzzle; memorising the past I have lived, <br>
The red spilling from my veins like port, <br>
Paint on a canvas every shade of peach I dry with the softest of blues <br>
</p>
     
 <p>      
The clouds bleach the purple sea, <br>
Dotted with shy guardians painting the tapestry, <br>
Breaths mirrored in the silver of lonely bedrooms - the souls of hundreds weaved this web,<br> 
Embraced the tight curls with the mountains <br>
 </p>
